# Jaws Attack - Team Matt Cooper

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and visualize data related to shark attacks worldwide. The dataset used in this project contains information about shark attacks such as location, date, type of activity, and more. By exploring this dataset, we aim to gain insights into factors influencing shark attacks and raise awareness about shark-human interactions.

## Important Notes

  ### Original Data Set
  The original dataset used in this project is found in (https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm). It includes information about shark attacks from various sources, compiled      into an extensive dataset, provided in excel format. It includes categories such as the date, time, location, type of encounter, species of shark, type of injury, activity that the     victim was doing prior to the attack, as well as many others.
  
  ### Problem & Hypothesis
  For many years, the Great White Shark has been given a bad reputation when it comes to human encounters, going as far as being the antagonist to the 1975 classic movie, Jaws. Given     that there are over 500 species of sharks in the world, is it possible that the top species in shark attacks is not in fact the Great White? Furthermore, despite it being a popular     fear in the ocean, we believe it is much more common for an injury to be non fatal in such encounters.
  
  ### Analysis
  The group aims to explore and analize the original data, focusing on the following:
    The various species of sharks recorded in the data set, filtering out the most popular
    The type of injuries most often presented and dividing them by fatal and non-fatal
